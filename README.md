# ðŸ“œ What is BASIC

BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of high-level programming languages created in 1964 by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth College.



Designed to be easy for beginners, especially for students.



Popular in the late 70s and 80s, especially on home computers like IBM PC, Apple II, and Commodore 64.



QBasic (Quick Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a modern descendant of BASIC used widely in the DOS era.
